I declare that no part of this thesis has been generated by AI software. These are my own words.

I acknowledge the use of AI technologies in the course of writing this thesis. Table \ref{tab:long} in Appendix \ref{ch:appendixThree} explained the relationship between the use and my work. The AI systems and links were particularised in column 1 of the schedule. The specific uses of Generative AI were particularised in column 2. The prompts used were listed in column 3. I entered those prompts on the dates particularised in column 4. The output from those prompts were particularised in column 5. The outputs from those prompts were used to explain subject matters particularised in column 6. The corresponding section numbers in my work in relation to those subject matters were particularised in column 7.
